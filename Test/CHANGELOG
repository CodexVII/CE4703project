Due to the removal of any scanf() in our main.c files a lot of changes had
to be made. Particularly to the way we create a dynamic array and how we
add coefficients.

a) polynomial.c
	modified: void initialise(polynomial *a, int size)
	1) Renamed to void initialisePolynomial(polynomial *a, int size)
	2) NULL check has been moved into the function
	3) Frees the polynomial under failure, initialises polynomial to 0 otherwise
	
	modified: void createPolynomial(polynomial *a)
	1) Renamed to addCoeff(polynomial *a, double coeff[])
	2) Now takes an array of values to become the coefficients of the polynomial
	
	modified: void printPolynomial(polynomial *a)
	1) Now adds a '+' sign when applicable
	2) Prints the polynomial with the highest degree first
	
b) polynomial.h
	1) Made adjustments to function declarations where needed.
	
c) main.c
	Description: This file is used to test every single function with given 
				 static arrays which will be the coefficients of our polynomials.
				 
				 Feel free to try your own test cases so we can discover bugs
				 and remidy them. However, make sure every time you allocate memory
				 that you free is later. Especially if you plan on re-using
				 that polynomial.
				 
				 I've made it to be fairly intuitive to change things as well but
				 ask me if there's anything wrong or a better way of doing it.
